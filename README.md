# Memory_Pair_Game
It is a Simple Memory Match Game Similar to the Purble Place - Purble Pairs.

I used some List Shuffling for Spawning each of the Tiles in Random Places and Made A deep copy of the Tiles to create pairs to Match.
I created the Flip Animation of the Game and the Tiles' Disappearance when matched using Unity Animation.
